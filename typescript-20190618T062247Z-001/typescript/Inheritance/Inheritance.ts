// the Employee class extends the Person class using extends keyword. This means that the Employee class now includes all the members of the Person class.

// The constructor of the Employee class initializes its own members as well as the parent class's properties using a special keyword 'super'. The super keyword is used to call the parent constructor and passes the property values.
// Note:
// We must call super() method first before assigning values to properties in the constructor of the derived class.
