// ES6 includes static members and so does TypeScript. 
// The static members of a class are accessed using the class name
//  and dot notation, without creating an object 
//  e.g. <ClassName>.<StaticMember>.

// The static members can be defined by using the keyword static.
//  Consider the following example of a class with static property.
