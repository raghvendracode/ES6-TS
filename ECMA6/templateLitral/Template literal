Template literals is a feature of ES6 which allows us to work with 
strings in a better way as when compared to ES5 and below. 
By simply using template literals, we can improve 
the code readability.Before ES6 we made use of ‘+’ operator
 whenever we wanted to concatenate strings and also 
 when we wanted to use a variable inside a string 
 which is definitely not a recommended method.
 Template literals use back-ticks(“) rather than the 
single or double quotes we’ve used to with regular strings.


// ES5 
var name = 'Hemant Kumar'; 
console.log('My name is '+ name);  
  
// ES6 
const name = 'Hemant Kumar'; 
console.log(`My name is ${name}`);
